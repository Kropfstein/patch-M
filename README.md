# patch-M
A TurtleWoW Patch to improve Teleport and Portal spell-icons for Alliance Mages.

About the **patch-M** :

It's a simple icon-remplacement patch I've made myself. The new TP and Portals icons are simply remplacing the old ones, with the exception of [Alah'Thalas] icons remplacing [Silvermoon] icons, and [Caverns of Time] icon replacing [Teleport: Stonard].

Why ? Because I was disappointed to see that there's no custom image for [Teleport: Alah'Thalas] and [Portal: Alah'Thalas]. As it uses the same Icons than [Teleport: Stormwind] and [Portal: Stormwind], I've resolved to make custom images for each spell.

Just download the patch-M and put it in your TurtleWow > Data folder, with the other patches.

BETTER COUPLED WITH ADDONS **RINGMENU** AND **MACROTT-V** !
